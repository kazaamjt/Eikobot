# Eikobot Desired State Engine

The little Desired State Engine that made it so.  

## Linters, type checkers, testing, etc

Currently this project uses:

- `mypy` for advanced type checking
- `isort` to auto format the imports
- `black` to auto format code
- `flake8` to do basic linting (and pointing out where isort and black would make changes)
- `pylint` for advanced linting and code smell detection

Note that the `flake8-isort` and `flake8-black` plugins are used,
and Flake8 will emit `isort` and `black` issues but not auto format them,
these tools will still need to be ran afterwards to fix any errors.  
The `Flake8-pylint` and `Flake8-mypy` plugins are not used as they are in broken state.  

For vscode, adding the following settings to your config is recommended:

```json
{
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "editor.insertSpaces": true,
}
```
